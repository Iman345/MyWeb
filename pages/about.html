    The blogs will be further broken downn into analysis, close-readings and reflections on valueble academic material relevant to data vizualization and the web.  
    We start with a small history of data visualization, discovering its origins and growth as technology changes. Next we take a look at different approaches to creating data visualizations that convey information effectively to the desired audience. We also look at different types of data visualization graphs and charts like pie charts and line graphs. Additionally, ethics in data and data visualization are discussed . We also observe and analyse examples of good data visualizations and how they convey information effectively to their desired audience.

    <h2 class = "p-name"> Data vizualizations</h2>
   <p> 
    Ever since the beginning of the COVID19 global pandemic, data visualizations have been key in illustrating the dense statistics of COVID. How many cases, the highest cases, most affected countries..etc, with increasing numerical values the information becomes harder and harder to retain and fully grasp. Thus, data visualizations have helped people globally comprehend the state of the world in relation to COVID19. The data visualizations on this website will try and create data visualizations that will help retain information on COVID in South Africa specifically. Since COVID19 affects every single person this information is relevant to everyone and thus must be crafted to suit the largest possible audience. However, the goal is to not cause overwhelming anxiety and increase fear but deliver dense and troubling statistics to allow people to process information about the global pandemic.
