        Janssens argues in their article freedom and data profiling that at the rate that algorithms are evolving and increasingly being rooted into most aspects of our lives, there is potential for algorithms to alter the very fabric of our identities and social behaviour and relationships. Algorithms already possess the function to accurately create individualised profiles and patterns based on our data, algorithms thus hold the ability to accurately map an “average you” (Janssens 2016). This phenomenon is known as data profiling. Jannsens’s argues that while data profiling can prove useful, it also presents an alarming risk factor. The risk factor of data profiling is that humanity might fall victim to being conceptualized only through systems grounded in probability. Therefore, Janssens implores us to critically reflect on how data profiles are constructed and to what extent we should use them to identify people with, additionally we should ask whether the analysis data profiles provide can ever truly ascertain and reflect the complexity of a human being. Can data that values probability over reality be trusted?

            Because technology is such a huge part of our lives, data collection for big data has entered our lives seamlessly without our acknowledgement or hesitation, we are being consistently observed. We are so used to our data being collected we never stop to question it, who is collecting my data, why and what is my data being used for? Additionally, major technological conglomerates and companies are consistently employing tools to grow the amount of data they can harvest.

            Another major issue with big data and big data analysis is responsibility and accountability.  Multiple organisations are involved and have privileges to our confidential data. Who do we hold accountable for our data, the company that harvests the data, those who analyze , those who sell our data to third parties?

        While we have legal frameworks, rights and frameworks that are meant to protect us in a digital space, they can not truly offer our freedom and privacy much protection. Despite technology becoming cheaper and more accessible, Janssens argues that while we feel it has enabled more freedom, our freedom has decreased. Algorithms are written and constructed by people, they are designed according to human choices and by human minds and hands thus they are prone to mistakes.  Therefore, the generated data analyses that are produced may not be accurate. Illustrating some of the shortcomings of big data analyses. Which leads Janssens to their next question “whether the use of big data analyses is effective or even justified”.

    </p>
    <p>
        Human beings are reduced to data profiles and the issues that Janssens is concerned about is that these data profiles are used to make decisions that impact human beings. Based on analyses real action is being taken but Janssen implores us to evaluate how this affects us and why we do not question it when it is central in our lives.
