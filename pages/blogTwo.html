   <p>Michael Friendly’s study of the history of data visualization through the Milestone project offers valuable insight on the past  of visual representation of data providing insight on challenges, methodology and cultural context which we can use to analyze how we use data visualization today. The Milestone Project embodies all significant developments in the history of data visualization in one comprehensive document.  The study offers a comprehensive history of data visualization covering the medieval period to the twenty-first century. Friendly uses the Milestones Project, to demonstrate how data visualization has grown and developed till today and how it was utilized in the past and subsequently how it is utilized now.

    <p>From this history one may also see that most of the innovations in data visualization arose from concrete, often practical goals: the need or desire to see phenomena, correlations,data, information and relationships in new or different ways. It is also clear that the development of graphic methods depended fundamentally on parallel advances in technology, data collection and statistical theory. Finally, I believe that the application of modern methods of data visualization to its own history, in this self-referential way I call “statistical historiography,” offers some interesting views of the past and challenges for the future.</p>

        Friendly studies the development of data visualization from the pre-17th Century era. Discussing how early maps and diagrams were used as early forms of data visualization.  Geometric diagrams, with tables detailing the position of the stars and constellations and maps created with the purpose to detail navigation are one of the earliest forms of data visualization. During the 16th century tools and specific techniques were developed to log and represent physical quantities and geographical location. The most significant innovation of this era was the triangulation method used for making more accurate maps, the use of tables in mathematics and the publishing of the First cartographic Atlas.

        The 1850s to the 1900s was known as the Golden Age of statistical graphics.The 1800-1850 era is known as the dawn of modern graphics and the 19th century saw great strides in development being made in the fields of statistical graphics and thematic mapping at an unmatched pace.  In the 18th century cartography progressed to display more detail in geography by illustrating isolines and contours. William Playfair [1759–1823] is accredited for creating graphical representations that are still increasingly popular until today. Line graphs, pie charts, bar charts, circle graphs are all of his invention and are crucial to data visualisation till today.

        Nearing the infancy of the 19th century bar, pie charts, histograms, line graphs and time-series plots, contour plots, scatterplots were all established and became regular practice in representing data. Maps were no longer just developed singularly but rather as comprehensive atlases, which not only served to aid navigation but contained data revolving around the locations  economic, social, moral, medical, physical statistics. Statistical data and visual representation of them showed its value to governments and they began establishing offices dedicated to statistical data.

The early 1900s are called the “modern dark ages” of  data visualization because no major developments were made in the field (Friendly and Denis, 2000). However starting from the 1950's into the 1970’s the field of data visualization began to flourish once again. The rebirth is accredited to the development of geographic information systems(GIS) and the introduction of interactivity within statistical graphs for both 2D and 3D(Friendly, 2006).

    The 20th century was a prosperous time in the field of data visualization with research on different spheres of data visualization being done , the development of software tools specifically built for data visualization produced for people to use on their devices and for their data. 

    </p>
   
    <p>
        From the  20th century until now the main focus and area of growth has been in dynamic and interactive data visualization. The focus falls on the development of the tools we use to create dynamic data visualization and the different methods of implementation. Dynamic data visualization is an incredibly powerful tool that gives us the ability to see updated data and observe it seamlessly in real time. Interactive data visualization holds immense value because it allows people to experience the data and absorb it in a more meaningful way as well as filter what they are interested in. During this time period, data visualization has made rapid and impressive strides in growth and development as a result of the growth of technology itself. We possess the tools to showcase important data in meaningful dynamic and interactive packages with the software and tools made more accessible than they were in the past, data visualization can continue growing in development and creators.
