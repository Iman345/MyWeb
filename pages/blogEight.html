        Knaflic argues that good data visualizations originated not from the visualization itself but rather from the visualization being grounded in well-researched context. I agree with Knaflic’s sentiment as without establishing the context of your data visualization it will fail to be meaningful. Furthermore, context is heavily based in understanding and identifying the audience. Specifying your audience will allow you to make informed decisions moving forward and create a visualization that will be of value. Having a vague and ambiguous audience will prevent you from connecting to your audience resulting in failing to communicate with them. For instance one on my visualization will be used to investigate the coursework of my third year. It will display the gender, ethnicities and nationalities of every prescribed reading to illustrate how the coursework is constructed for each subject and conclude whether each course is still heavily based in eurocentrism or there is more diversity. The audience and context of this data visualization will be key in its effectiveness and value. My audience will be my fellow students and my course-coordinators. 


       </p>
        
        <p>
            
            The more specific and in-depth you investigate your audience the better you can cater to their needs and shape your data visualization to connect  and communicate with them effectively. After identifying your audience it is important to understand the reasons your information and data is relevant and important to them. By identifying these factors, you can create a data visualization that will be appealing to your audience.
        </p>
        
      
        <p>
            Another essential factor to identify is the mechanism that will communicate with your target audience. The mechanism impacts how you communicate with your audience and thus decides how your information will be received by the audience. Different types of people will react differently and perceive the information differently depending on the mechanism. Once you ascertain who, what and how Knaflic further discusses different types of charts and graphs that can be used. There are a wide array of various graphs to choose from but Knaflic discusses the few core graphs that can be used for most instances and fulfill all your needs. 

        </p>
        
    
    <p>
        While text can be used to illustrate information that has one or two numerical figures from there it gets more complicated. For example, 100% of men are trash can be effectively communicated like this. However, if I began adding other figures this data visualization will not be effective in relating information to the audience. Tables and/or graphs will cater for the information beyond two figures more effectively.


    </p>
       <p>
        Tables are easy to read and digest for audiences and can cater for a wide audience because they need only look at the row and column that interests them. It also allows audiences to easily compare items in the table. The design of the table is important in ensuring it relays its contents effectively. If we made everything one colour and the same fonts and sizes the information would be difficult to read. By using different colours or shades of colours (heat) to identify trends and other effective use of table properties the data can be well communicated and easily understood.

       </p>

       <p>
        Another key data visualization are graphs, graphs encompass a large array of options to choose, again the choice of graph largely depends on the context of the data. Knaflic states that graphs communicate faster than tables because it engages with us on a more visual level which allows us to process information faster. Because graphs are so effective in communicating information the most general and adaptable ones are worth discussion, thus the remainder of this article will discuss points, bar, line and area graphs.

       </p>

       <p>
        Bar graphs can be plotted horizontally or vertically and make use of rectangular bars that correspond to specific values using height to illustrate categorical data.  They allow us to easily recognise what category is the largest, smallest which categories rely on the medium and which share common values as well as the differences between each category. Bar graphs are highly popular because they convey information easily and can be used for diverse and varied data. Therefore, they appeal to a large audience because they are rather flexible.

       </p>
       <p>
        Line graphs are graphs where data points are marked off at a x and y during a specified time interval, the data points are connected using a line to display the trends of the periodic data. There can be multiple lines of the graph displaying different data.


       </p>
       <p>
        Knaflic warns against specific data visualizations because they are hard to read and can confuse the audience. They name area graphs and 3D pie charts as part of this category. Area graphs position display graphical quantitative on a line chart. The data can be difficult to comprehend because the numbers or statistics and the visual space displayed prove difficult to make connections largely because the space is two-dimensional(Knaflic 2015).This is not always the case but is important to bear in mind when choosing a graph to map your data. A 3D pie chart can be highly problematic because its issue lies in its misinterpretation of data.  The 3D perspective can largely be held responsible for displaying data inaccurately because it makes some pieces appear smaller and subsequently others appear  bigger than they should. Because 3D perspective qqewers the data Knaflic proclaims a  rule  “don’t use 3D! It does nothing good”. Therefore, when choosing a graph choose the graph that will convey information most effectively to an audience and will allow them to easily digest, understand the data (Knaflic 2015).

       <p>
        After choosing your preferred graph, you need to ensure that the data is given the spotlight and communicated effectively. To ensure information is clear and easily readable, it is essential to declutter your data visualization. 
        Knaflic states these techniques are generally most effective :
        
       </p>
       <ul>
       <li>
        De‐emphasize the chart title, by not making the title bold the focus is on the chart and not the title. 


       </li> 

       <li>
        Clean up the visualization by removing borders and gridlines. 
       </li>
       <li>
        Ensure labels are in the background and do not pull focus by being too bright and big. 
       </li>
        <li>
            Have coherent and clear colour schemes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use colour strategically and meaningfully. 
        </li>
       
        <li>
            Align elements such as titles and labels properly
        </li>
        
       <li>
        Use simple and easy to read text and fonts
       </li>
        
        
       </ul>

       <p>
           While Knaflic has an enire book on how to create effective and good data visualization's this serves as a summary of the most important pieces of information when begging to design data visualizations.
