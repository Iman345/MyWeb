        As a digital designer Tanne van Bree notes their curiosity on the influence of technology in everyday life which brought them to observe the change that the digital age has had on our memory. From that observation Van Bree presents the concept of digital hyperthymesia. Digital Hyperthymesia “describes the phenomenon of the digitisation of the externalisation of human memory processes”. In the digital age, Digital Hyperthymesia is a condition embedded in  all of our lives. Any time we need to recollect memories we can easily find it through filtering our own digital databases. Van Bree focuses on self-created databases exploring the impact and potential consequences of Digital hyperthymesia. Our emerging and increasing reliance on digital memory is due to the big part technology plays in our lives and how it has become integrated in our everyday existence. Using digital storage for our data has become a norm in our society. Means of creating and sharing collective intelligence has always been an important societal need throughout time. Humanity has consistently worked to create ways of sharing and creating shared knowledge that would be sustained throughout time and space. In this era, we can have a record for everything because technology allows us to store and save everything.

            In the digital age we now reside in we are able to easily and seamlessly externalize our memory and create shared knowledge that can surpass the test of time and space.  No memory has to be forgotten which ultimately alters our view on human memory.  Van Bree argues that because of technology most people view human memory as inherently flawed because it can be influenced, altered and forgotten because computers can hold memories in perfect condition and will be saved for an unlimited time. Therefore, unlike computers our memories hold imperfect information that may be altered or erased as time goes on. However, van Bree argues that the flaws of our memory hold value and are not really flaws but necessary for us. Van Bree uses Borges words “to think is to forget’”, to explain that forgetting is an essential human function and is what makes us human. If we remembered everything we would get lost in the overload of information that would constantly flood our minds. We should re-evaluate the way we think of our memory and see that it holds more value than we may think and we should not completely replace our memory processes with technology.

            Due to technology the very function of our memory has changed now that we have access to unlimited sources of information. Before technology, memorising information and remembering it would signify knowledge. This has changed. We do not memorise knowledge any longer instead we concern ourselves with locating knowledge. Van Bree takes the position that this change of how we think , will negatively impact the quality of our reflections, reasoning and decision making processes. Instead of trying to critically analyze and evaluate we opt for ‘solutionism’, we immediately look towards technology to solve our problems. Van bree states that this holds consequences because we exclusively depend on technology instead of “critically reflecting” on information. In conclusion, Van Bree argues that because of digital hyperesthesia we have fallen into a cycle of using external sources to store and operate “memory processes” resulting in an increasing passive use of our “internal memory” leading to a reduction of quality in our thought, reflective and decision processes.
