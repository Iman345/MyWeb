        Data Visualization has always been associated with having a scientific nature because it provides further reinforcement of factual data of a normally quantitative nature. Therefore, the people who utilized data visualization were those using it to demonstrate their hypothesis or information in an easily digestible way. However, data visualization has experienced a new transformation making its way into the world of art and creativity. This short paper will revolve around artistic data visualization using Fernanda Viégas and  Martin Wattenberg’s Beyond Visual Analytics as the main source material to explore the concept.

            In the current era that we live in, you do not need the expansive knowledge  or expensive software to do data visualization allowing it to be open and utilized by a larger and diverse audience of creators. Data visualization tools are more easily accessible due to the internet, data visualization has found purposes and uses across multiple disciplines.Data visualization is moving away from just being clinically and scientifically utilized and being utilized in a more artistic and creative form, becoming art in itself. Viégas and Wattenberg struggle to explain the concept of  “artistic” visualization simply and rightfully so, since art itself is indefinable.

            While the tools and techniques are the same across all data visualizations, the difference between a scientific and artistic data visualization lies beyond just presentation, it also lies in the creators intentions. A scientific intention of data visualization is to provide presumably “unbiased” information and facts to support or prove a hypothesis or theory. Artistic intention with data visualization is to create art that is  “new and different” (Viégas, Wattenberg 2007) and thus that is the definition the authors use to describe artistic data visualization. Viégas and Wattenberg name another additional factor besides intention in defining what is artistic data. For a piece of art to be categorised as an artistic data visualization it must of course be foundationally grounded on  data. This also means that just because a scientific data visualization is presented in an artistic and aesthetic way, it is by no means an artistic visualization because that is not its intention. Viégas and Wattenberg additionally note that the idea of “beauty” and “aesthetic” does not mark an artistic data visualization, the distinguishing factor lies in intention.




            Viégas and Wattenberg analyse an array of artistic data visualizations. They conclude that it is the subversion and breaking of data visualization laws to create commentary and illustrate a point that makes artistic data visualization and additionally what makes it so powerful. Demonstrating their main point that the difference between artistic data visualizations and other data visualizations is that they communicate a “forceful point of view”(Viégas, Wattenberg 2007).
