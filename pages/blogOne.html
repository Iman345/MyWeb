   <p> "We live immersed in representation: it is how we understand our environments and each other. It is also how we both are, and how we understand ourselves; representation is implicated in the process of me becoming me. (Webb 2009: 3)
    "</p>
    
    <p>Representation is a concept that holds the utmost value in our lives because it shapes and molds how we understand ourselves, each other, our environments; it molds our identities and the identities of those around us (Webb 2009 : 3). This document will not try and define representation or its historical origins but rather discuss the discourse of representation in different capacities. Kidd discusses representation of reality; representation and myth; representation and visual culture; representation as persuasion; and representation and identity politics. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Representation and Reality</h3>
    <p>
        This section will detail how representation is used to construct reality by producing meaning, this concept will be deconstructed through the lens of Stuart Hall’s “constructivist”  theory.  In order to understand and dissect these concepts the term “Semiotics” needs to be understood as it is the very core of these notions. Semiotics is the study of signs. Each sign can have a multitude of meanings because signs are a  man made construction. Whoever builds the sign will construct it in order to highlight this one meaning above all the other potential meanings (Hall, 1997). Because there are a multitude of possible meanings, the audience will connotate specific meanings  to each sign which is another sphere of semiotics understanding the interpretations of signs. Ferdinand de Saussure is hailed as the father of semiotics,  who defined a sign as the product of the signifier and signified merging. The signifier is the form of a sign (its sound, how it looks, how it's written, an image),  and the signified is the idea the form is expressing or reperenting. The relationship between the sign and signified is completely arbitrary because the relationship is constructed by social and cultural context and can be changed easily. Saussure argues that “difference” is what enables meaning to exist because we can easily identify differences therefore it is easy to find meaning within contrast of binary opposites(Hall , 1997).  Now that we have established a  basis of how signs are encoded, decoded and constructed we can begin to ascertain how meaning is constructed by them.

 
    </p>
    <p>
        Signs are encoded with meanings by man and thus what we think is good, bad, true, natural, logical or illogical is a mere construction. Nothing is born into the world with meaning but it is assigned a meaning (Hall 1997: 25). Signs make meaning which shapes and creates our reality. 


    </p>

    <h3>Representation and myth</h3>
    <p>

        Renowned semiotician Roland Barthes presents the concept of “myth” in representation as a special type of speech (Barthes, ).  Barthes states that every symbol has a denotation and a connotation tethered to it. A denotative reading is a study of the symbols form, while a connotative meaning analyzes the underlying meaning.  For instance, the triangular Ku Klux Klan symbol, a denotative reading would be it is a big triangle which contains a small triangle. However, a connotative reading would be that it actually represents three letter K's aligned in a triangle and facing inwards and represents white supremacy,racism, homophobia ,islamophobia, transphobia, sexism ...etc,   it is a synonymous symbol of hate. 

    </p>

    <p>
        Barthes claims that specific symbols have connotations that are so powerful and grossly popular that they surpass being just connotations and cross over into the realm of myth. Barthes uses myth to describe the phenomenon when a  specific group or persons philosophy, ideology or meaning is constructed as a fact, a truth something natural and not a mere built man-made construction.

    </p>
<h3>Representation and Visual Communication</h3>
    <p>
        Effective visual communication can be an incredibly difficult task to achieve because of the ambiguous and subjective nature of visual images. Images consist of symbols that have a multitude of potential meanings, though they are encoded with a preferred meaning that becomes irrelevant, this is best explained by Barthes Death of the Author, which explains that despite being embedded with meaning the objects meaning is ultimately left to the audience. Images meanings can also change based on context, culture and time thus meaning is not fixed in images (Gripsrud 2006: 32). 


    </p>
    <p>

        Therefore, Kidd presents possible strategies to keep in mind on the topic of interpreting images. When looking and producing an image specifically in this case involving visual communication it is key to understand the images presentational context, production context, historical context and the context of reception. The image's presentational context refers to the way the image appears, its form. The production context refers to the images origins in terms of who produced, where it was produced and how it was produced. The image's historical context refers to the moment in time and culture in which the image was produced because meanings change and fluctuate depending on geographical, social, political,cultural and historical factors. It is also important to note the images relation to other images and cultural objects. It is important to understand this image's origins and its history until this moment in time. The context of reception refers to the social circumstances in which we absorb and receive the image and how that dictates what meaning we take. When we receive the image, the time, place, people and other social environment factors can play a vital role in how the meaning of the image is received. 

    </p>
    <h3>Representation as Persuasion
    </h3>

    <p>
        Representation holds the power and ability to persuade. However, Kidd warns this tool of persuasion can prove dangerous. We see persuasion happening in advertising when the images and data visualization and infographics are meant to sway people to consume a certain product . However, we are often aware of the intention of persuasion in advertising otherwise we are unconsciously being persuaded. Kidd suggests that representations are built and constructed in a certain way to market views, opinions, information as objects and true to persuade the audience or target market to take the preferred meaning of the representation and adopt its embedded message.

    </p>

    <h3>Representation and politics</h3>
    <p>

        Representation is a powerful business because it has the power to naturalize.
Stuart Hall describes Naturalization as the process that allows an ideology, opinion , perceptions and philosophies which are all man-made constructions as something natural, a a fact of the world that can not be disputed, it can not be challenged because it is fixed as absolute knowledge (Hall, 1997, 245-250). Thus representation can prove to be problematic and dangerous. The Western ideologies and philosophies control most representation in popular culture and the mainstream media, an example is Orientalism. Orientalism is best explained by Edward Said when he notes that Edward Said argues that “European culture was able to manage- and even produce the Orient politically, sociologically, militarily, ideologically, scientifically and imaginatively.” Orientalism naturalizes the ideology that the West is civilized and superior to the barbaric and backwards East. Thus, representation is never neutral but always involved in the business of politics. In terms of representation in mass and mainstream media there has rarely been substantial representation. Minorities and marginalized people are still misrepresented and  underrepresented with dangerous consequences. Because those who construct representation in popular and mainstream culture and media are Western,  white, hetrosexual, Christian men. 

    </p>
<p>
    
</p>
    <p>
        Representation has the power to shape people's worldviews and thought processes, it has power over our perception of other people, cultures and societies additionally it entrenches itself in how we see ourselves. Therefore, as creators it is of the utmost importance to understand the different spheres of representation as to not uphold oppressive Hegemonic Western practices and offer progressive visual data and communication that is beneficial and does not seek to “other”.
