       <p> 
        This website hosts an array of information, from blogs to data visualizations. The blogs are not directly about the visualizations but impact how they are created. Therefore, this website is not inspired by a specific theme but rather an emotional aesthetic. Blogs about data visualization can be extremely meta and full of difficult questions about information society, big data and other big topics that are shaping our society. Because the theory can be dense, I want a calm and soothing feel for this website, one that is gentle and makes the information a bit more easily digestible. Therefore, gentle and calm are the main reasoning behind the colour scheme, visuals and fonts.

For the colour palette of the website, a dive into colour theory suggests that pale colours offer the gentle and calm effect that I hope to invoke. From this pale pink and a pale powder blue were chosen as the main colours and black/ white for most of the text. By keeping colours to a minimum and selecting gentle colours the website appears calm and not busy and distracting. The colours do not interfere with the readers abilities to read the text and do not render the text unreadable to colour blind audiences.

            Next the front page has a sakura or a cherry blossom tree greeting visitors. The tree fits in with the main colour scheme and also invites an air of Spring and freshness to the website. It’s not a major symbol of the website but rather a small motif that can be noticed, to provide a bit of atmosphere. The font chosen was selected because it is easy to read but adds a bit of playfulness to the website.
