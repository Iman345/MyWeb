        A common trend with data visualization and COVID 19 statistics are dashboards with multiple different graphs and charts to show different data in a central and convenient location. I hoped to recreate this on a smaller scale. The information in the graphs are geared towards the general South African population because COVID 19 has affected all citizens in some way or another. For my final I incorporated multiple bar graphs combined with line graphs and three donut charts illustrating one or two statistics. Each of the bar graphs contains different data, there are five in total. The first bar graph depicts the total accumulated Coronavirus cases in South Africa from the 31st of March until the 22nd of November. The rest of the graph displays the accumulated COVID 19 cases for each of the four most densely populated provinces, namely : Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal. I decided to display this data because it is nearing the end of the year, and the gravity of the situation has been played down within South Africa. With lockdown easing people have forgotten how easily and fast corona spreads and this can serve as a reminder. Additionally, this data signifies how the pandemic spread across South Africa which is information that can serve South Africans trying to understand COVID 19 better or comprehend its devastating effects and speed. Each graph shows how fast and how many cases can be contracted within a month  by both the bar graph and the line graph. The user can choose whether they would like to see the line or not because sometimes, the linge graph makes it difficult to see the values on the bar chart clearly, additionally it would have been a good feature to have the bars disappear to show the line graph as well.

            The bar graph communicates the exact number of the accumulated cases every month and the line graph is used to show how the great growth in cases as the year has gone by. The bar graph visualizes the information and the line graph visualizes and emphasizes the trend of how cases increased. Thus, the audience can toggle the line graph on and off, if sole focus on the bar graphs is desired. The bar graph uses heat to signify the different severity of the cases. The higher the number of cases the darker the bars in the graph will get. A good improvement on the line graph is to also have a colour change as the graph increases to signify when the cases are extremely high, average or low.

            Underneath the bar graphs comes a small section of donut charts. There are three donut charts each showing different data related to COVID 19. The charts with more than one statistic have tooltips. The tooltips however are a bit difficult to navigate and will only appear when the mouse is still on the specific slice, which is not ideal, ideally it should work during dynamic movement of the mouse and not just static.  While donut charts are often put in the same boat as pie charts with communicating data in a way that is difficult to digest. However, it is common to use donut charts to show one or two statistics as it will unlikely cause the situation where data can be misconstrued data. Across COVID 19 websites these donut charts have been used to show recovery rates, fatality rates..etc. Therefore, instead of just reading a big number or a statistic and forgetting them, these donut charts allow audiences to visualize the statistics and retain the information better. The audience can compare two statistics and see how they compare for themselves instead of just reading plain numbers and not being able to see it. I chose data that I personally found interesting about COVID19 and was unaware of until I did some researching for the data visualizations.
