        This era of technology has established data visualization as an accessible, essential and powerful tool of representation of data. Data in stories often functions to support, explain or show evidence of information and subsequently give it credibility and legitimacy.  Data, while incredibly important can be difficult, time-consuming and tedious to comprehend, thus data visualization is crucial in representing data in an easily understandable way. Therefore, a clear shift towards the usage of data visualization in data-driven stories in all media disciplines can be observed.

            Riche uses the phrase “a picture is worth a thousand words” to explain the rationale behind the ever increasing popularity and necessity of data visualization. In modern day society, the use of data visualization has become standard practice, we can observe it in almost all our media, from the news to magazines (Riche et al.  2018). Data visualization is a tool we have used to help us make sense of the world around us since the early dawn of humanity (Riche et al 2018). The growth and development of data visualization tools are relative to the growth of technology and in the time of computers and the internet data visualization tools have reached new heights. The value of visualization in data driven stories, is to make the data readable while offering a sense of credibility of evidence as seen in journalism and academic research.

            Data driven storytelling (DDs) functions to communicate a narrative using datasets in order to illustrate its meaning effectively by using the power of visualization. DDs can use visualization for exploratory and explanatory functions. Exploratory features allow the reader agency to experience stories in the way they see fit, explanatory features function to contextualise the data and communicate the authors message to their audience. 
            Riche et al discuss the important factors to consider that govern how DDs should be structured alongside data visualization.When it comes to narrative is essential to employ specific narrative techniques employed to seamlessly integrate data visualization into DDs and embed the desired intention for the intended market. It is crucial to take into account that users will access the story across a multitude of devices and platforms which should be an accommodation that is always present. Anticipation of the audience's knowledge and needs  are other pieces of information that will shape effective communication within DDs.
